Using a combination of Java, Spring MVC, Java Database Connection (JDBC), JQuery, JSPs, bootstrap and postgreSQL, I built my website 
for the purpose of expressing my interests as well as showcasing my new programming abilities. It should be up and running at aaronshafron.com
sometime soon. I'm currently having trouble connecting my database with Heroku's database hosting service.
