Using a combination of Java, Spring MVC, Java Database Connection (JDBC), JQuery, JSPs, bootstrap and postgreSQL, I built my website 
mainly for the purpose of expressing my interests. I downloaded data from Yahoo finance into some csv files then copied that data into a postgres database. You can check out the site at www.aaronshafron.com.
